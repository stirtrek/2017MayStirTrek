If you give a developer a dot, she'll want to create an Alexa skill. If she creates a skill, she'll want to create a lambda service. When she creates the lambda service, she'll want to persist data. When she has a service with a datastore, she'll want to build a mobile/web CRUD interface to that datastore. When she defines an API for that CRUD, she'll want to reuse the lambda services and create well-engineered shared libraries. And since she wants to do all of that, she’ll first have to attend this session!
